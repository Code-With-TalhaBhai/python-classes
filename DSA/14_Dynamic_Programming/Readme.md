There are four ways to approach Dynamic Programming Question

***1. Without DP -> Recurrsive Backtracking***
```
    Time-Complexity -> O(2*n)
```


***2. Top-Down Approach(memoization)***
```
    Time-Complexity -> O(n)
    Space-Complexity -> O(2*n) -------> Recurrsive Stack + Extra Memoize_Dictionary
```

***3. Bottom-up Approach(Tabulation)***
```
    Time-Complexity -> O(n)
    Space-Complexity -> O(n) -------> Due to extra array
```


***4. Bottom-up No-memory DP***
```
    Time-Complexity -> O(n)
    Space-Complexity -> O(1) -------> No additional space
```
